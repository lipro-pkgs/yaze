SYNOPSIS
========

| |command| [ ``-cpm`` [ `FILE` ] ] [ ``-d`` [ `DIR[GLOB]` ] ] [ ``-f`` [ `GLOB` ] ] [ ``-r`` ]
| |command| ``-h``


DESCRIPTION
===========

|command| executes a Tcl program, copying complete directories or selected
files by glob pattern to or from a CP/M disk image file. This will be done
by calling the Yaze CP/M disk manager program, the ``cdm`` command.

Glob patterns must be quoted so that the shell does not expand them before
passing the argument to the script.

``-cpm`` [ `FILE` ]
    Define the name of the CP/M disk image file `FILE`. Default is the
    name of the current directory with ``.dsk`` appended.

    For default direction from host to CP/M disk image file, if the file
    does not exist, a new empty CP/M disk image file will be created.

``-d`` [ `DIR[GLOB]` ]
    Define the directory pathname of the host directory `DIR` to be
    copied or updated. Default is the name of the current directory.

    For default direction from host to CP/M disk image file, if the path
    is a directory name, all the files in the directory will be copied.
    If the path includes a quoted glob pattern `DIRGLOB`, only the
    selected files will be copied. Ex.: ``-d 'work/cpm/*.ASM'``.

    For reverse direction (``-r``) from CP/M disk image file to host just
    the directory path should be supplied, all files from the CP/M disk
    will be copied to the host directory unless the a filter is supplied
    (see the ``-f`` option).

``-f`` [ `GLOB` ]
    Define the CP/M file glob pattern `GLOB` selects files to be copied
    from CP/M disk. Ex.: ``-f '*.ASM'``.

``-h``
    Describe how to use this CP/M disk image copy tool.

``-r``
    Reverse copy from CP/M disk image file to host, instead of default host
    to CP/M disk image file.
