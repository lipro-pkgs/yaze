Upstream-Name: yaze - Yet Another Z80 Emulator
Upstream-contact: Frank D. Cringle <fdc@cliwe.ping.de>
Source: ftp://ftp.ping.de/pub/misc/emulators/
    The pristine upstream source contains obfuscated files, that are
    thereby not appropriate for use as source files. This violates DFSG §2.
    .
    The 'debian/repack' program will removes those files to create the Debian
    upstream source tarball.
    .
    The orig.tar.xz is just repacked Debian upstream source tarball
    (currently without changes). See section get-orig-source in 'debian/rules'
    file and array nonfree_fileglobs in 'debian/repack' file for details.

Comment:
    It was prompted by Michael Haardt's work on emulation of non-CP/M
    Z80-Systems.  He contributed the io.c file and the bank switching
    memory logic, which may provide a platform for running MP/M and
    UZI on the emulator.
